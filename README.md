These are notes of my classes in introduction to computing. This is a a 1th semester theme, but I took in 2th semester due to Covi-19 restrictions. The lessons was gave by professor Rivera. <br/>
I used some Google images to ilustrated key concepts. There a lot of images from Rivera's slides and some references from web papers. I'm a freshman, so be kind, everything is raw and new to me. I hope that some part could be useful for you! <br/>
Thank u, Binha! <br/>
